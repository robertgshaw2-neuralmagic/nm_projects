# System Logging Metrics

DeepSparse provides System Logging to enable out-of-the-box monitoring of system performance and health. 

### Groups
The following metric groups are enabled by default:
|Group                |Description  |Identifier in YAML Config Files|
|---------------------|-------------|-------------------------------|
|Deployment Details   |xxx          |`deployment_details`           |
|Request Details      |xxx          |`request_details`              |
|Prediction Latency   |xxx          |`prediction_latency`           |
|Engine Batch Latency |xxx          |`batch_latency`                |
